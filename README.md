## Portland User Groups, May 29-30, 2019

We'll show you how to use a state of pipeline to unredact (inaccurately) the Mueller Report at Portland Meetups May 29 & 30:

- Thurs May 30 at New Relic: [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/pdxpython/events/gmxlbqyzhbfc) and [slides](slides/)

Many of the techniques we use are explained in detail in [**N**atural **L**anguage **P**rocessing **i**n **A**ction](http://bit.ly/npia-py). 

### Unredacting the Mueller Report

At the Portland Python User Group, May 30, 2019, we'll show you use a simple RNN to predict the next words or sentences in any document. We'll then show how it's able to compose reasonable guesses for the text in the redactions (black boxes) of the Mueller Report. Then we'll show you how to use transfer learning in Keras with the state-of-the-art BERT language model to bring in information from outside the report text to improve the accuracy of the generated text, but only for short redactions.

## Tensorflow World 2019 in Santa Clara

At [TensorFlow.world 2019](https://conferences.oreilly.com/tensorflow/tf-ca), on Oct 28-31 Al Kari, Garrett Lander, Chrisand Hobson Lane from Manceps will be presenting our experience with NLP at scale for long technical documents, like medical records. 

### Learned Semantic Distance Metrics

At Tensor Flow World 2019 we'll show the results of our investigation into the latest NL embeddings and their usefulness for search and abstractive summarization:

- USE
- BERT
- GPT2

### Deep Learning Adversarial Attack and Defense

At Tensor Flow World 2019 we'll show how to identify vulnerabilities in your machine learning brain from adversarial attacks:

- Image classification
- Document classification

### Abstractive Summarization of Long Technical Documents
